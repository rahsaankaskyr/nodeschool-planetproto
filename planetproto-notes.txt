Mission

The goal of this workshop is to help you understand the object model in Javascript by learning how prototypes work.

Most guides / tutorials start explaining JavaScript objects by going directly to ‘constructor functions’, this workshop is different, it starts simple by explaining prototype chains and building from there.

Please read the exercises thoroughly and follow all conditions, they are there to help you learn!
